<p class="py-2">I am very much in love with BSV and its capabilities. And it is a great pleasure to participate in this Run Hackathon.</p>

<p class="py-2">I am very excited with the LicenseIn idea, but I know it is a very simple project for now. This can be something really really huge, and I have a great vision of all the thing that can be done to make these onchain licenses a great product.</p>

<p class="py-2">I worked very very hard all these days, and now, I just need to sleep. I cant write anymore... Later I update this page.</p>
